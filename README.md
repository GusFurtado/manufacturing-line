# Manufacturing Line in Python

A Python toolset for manufacturing line simulation and optimization.

## Instalation

- None yet. I'll release it on PyPI when it is at least half-decent.

## Documentation

- None yet. This is a very rough draft that will change significantly.

## What can this package do now?

- Build a manufacturing line using machines and buffers instances;
- Simulate the line with Simpy;
- Draw the line with NetworkX.

## What will this do in the future?

- Otimizations and suggestions, such as changing buffer capacity or machine speed.

## Could you please explain the underlying theory?

- I could, but I won't. I'm kinda busy right now.
